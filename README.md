# TripleDigit

Interesting number problem came up upon myself while leaving a store this last week.

Can one come up with a 3 digit number, then using those same three digits in a different order (if needed) to form a second 3 digit number, then add the two 3 digit numbers together to add up to a three digit number that is only composed of those three digits...

Aside from 000.
